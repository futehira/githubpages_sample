Use next-day shipping as Station 4 is currently down. We have been informed that the Controller Module (Type-C) is out of stock until next week, so just order the sensor for now.

      "answer": 1,

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "文書3より「現時点ではセンサー（$400）のみ注文」し、「翌日配送（$50）」を利用します。合計 $450 です。モジュール（$1,200）は在庫切れで注文を見送ったため、10%割引（$1,000以上）は適用されません。"

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "文書3の「so just order the sensor for now（今はセンサーだけ注文して）」および「module in a separate budget next month（モジュールは来月の別予算で）」という記述から、今回の注文には含まれないことがわかります。"
