We plan to keep SRV-B running continuously for the next 12 months, so we would like to switch it to the Reserved Instance pricing starting next month. Also, I noticed an extra charge for data transfer. Based on our logs, only 20GB of the SRV-B transfer was outbound to the internet, while the rest was internal. Please verify if internal transfers are exempt from the $0.05/GB fee as per our enterprise contract."
