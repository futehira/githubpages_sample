Sato <t.sato@embedded-dev.jp>\nTo: Procurement Dept\nDate: February 15\n\nRegarding the upcoming 'Rust-Node' project expansion, we currently have 12 engineers but only enough licenses to support 6 people simultaneously (3 shared floating seats + 3 fixed licenses). Since 5 of our new members work in different time zones, we want to purchase 2 additional Floating licenses instead of individual ones. Also, I would like to convert my personal Node-Locked license (TC-005) to a Floating one so I can access it from both my office and lab PCs. Please process this before the renewal date."
