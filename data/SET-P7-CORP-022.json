I apologize for the delay, as I was waiting for the signed form from Zen Studio, which finally arrived yesterday. Please note that for my nutrition coaching on March 26, the facility manager could not sign the form in person because it was a virtual session. Instead, I have attached the email confirmation from the coach. I hope this suffices for the full $30 reimbursement."
