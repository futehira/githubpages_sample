We have not processed your payment yet. To avoid further overage charges, we recommend upgrading to 'Professional'. If you pay the December bill by January 20, we will waive the late fee. However, if you stay on the Basic plan for December, you must pay for the extra users ($15 per additional user) plus the standard storage overage."
