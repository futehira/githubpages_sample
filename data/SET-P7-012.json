I originally signed up for WS-02 because I am developing a desktop application. However, my project focus has shifted to microcontrollers. Could you please switch my workshop registration to the one led by Alice Vance? I understand there is a price difference and am happy to pay the balance. Also, can you confirm the room for the new session?"
