I am looking specifically for a way to synchronize binary files for my clients in Asia and Europe, and I wonder if your current upgrade would cover this for me. Since I work with high-security firmware, I would like the data to be encrypted during the transfer. Please reach out to me at my office number between 9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. JST.\n\nThank you,\n\nTakashi Sato\nEmbeddedDev Japan"
