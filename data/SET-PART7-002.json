    "Document 3: Email From Kenji Sato (May 26). Subject: Workshop follow-up. Dear HR, I really enjoyed Sarah Jenkins' session yesterday. The tips on shortcut keys were especially helpful. However, I noticed that the boxed lunch provided didn't have a label for ingredients. Since I have a specific dietary restriction, I had to skip the meal. Could you ensure labels are included for the next session on June 15?"
