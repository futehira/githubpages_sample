Given that my Global Tech Fund has performed so well, I'd like to move half of my Cash Reserve into it to maximize my gains. Also, I am very interested in the US Treasury Bonds mentioned. Can you tell me if 'Secure Bonds B' in my current list follows similar trends, or should I wait for the webinar on the 20th?"
