Unfortunately, the paint was not the one I had asked for. I had selected color SP 944 but received SP 945 (Ocean Waves). They appear right next to each other on your Web site, so the two may have been confused at your end. Could you send me the correct paint, along with additional samples that are close in color to SP 722? That sample worked well in my house; the others looked too green on my walls.\n\nThank you,\nArun Phan"
